As a local business owner you understand that you have one huge source of competition, corporate chains. With this, it's extremely important to stand out as a small business, you'll need your business to catch the eye. What better place to do this than on the web? This is where local SEO comes into play.

In the internet driven world we live in today, SEO gives you the perfect way to get your business noticed and more importantly, get more customers. How? According to Bradley Shaw at SEO Expert, [88% of consumer local business searches on mobile either call or visit the business within 24 hours, 46% of all searches on Google are seeking local information, and 97% searched online to find a local business](https://www.seoexpertbrad.com/local-seo-stats/).

That alone is extremely convincing, just imagine the potential for your small business with these statistics alone. The internet is the best place by far for attracting new customers and making them lifelong customers because of your outstanding service or product.

There’s no doubt that an effective internet marketing strategy can help you catch the eye and as far as internet marketing strategies go, there’s probably none more powerful than SEO.

If you want to take your local business to the next level, you need to get yourself some SEO. Lucky for you, we're in the mood to give you the tools to do this. Interested in affordable SEO consulting or having SEO done for you, [we offer streamlined packages that get your business ranking](https://www.seo-bird.com/services). Here's why SEO is a must have for your business.

## What is SEO?

Before we delve into what SEO is, there’s something you need to know first about SERPs. SERP means Search Engine Results Page. Every time you make a search on Google, Yahoo, Bing, or any other search engine, you’ll get a results page. This page shows you multiple results for the query you have sent and allows you to pick any one that is relevant to you.

You’ll notice that the SERPs are usually in the form of a list, and while it’s not usually numbered, you’ll get around 9-10 results on each page (on Google at least). Since there’s hardly any screen in the world that will show you all 10 results at once, you often have to scroll down to see more than the first 5-6 results. Here’s where it gets interesting.

Statistics show that the ***[top 5 results on Google SERPs get nearly 70% of all clicks](https://www.theleverageway.com/blog/how-far-down-the-search-engine-results-page-will-most-people-go/)***. Apparently, people don’t have any interest in scrolling downwards. They just go right ahead and pick one of the top five results on the page. This means if your local business is amongst the first five, you won’t be getting any new leads.

Yes. There’s some poor guy’s (or girl’s) page right down there in the dark, nether regions of the SERPs. The only difference between the results on the first page and the bazillionth? *A little thing called SEO*.

The full meaning of SEO is Search Engine Optimization. It entails every activity targeted at increasing your online business ranking on SERPs.

Since the first page of SERPs is where all the action is, SEO strategies help you methodically improve your businesses web pages so that you can rank favourably on the SERPs. All of this is done in a measurable and repeatable manner, hence why SEO could be the most important aspect of your online ventures. Unlike paid advertisements and social media, the way of getting customers to click on your site doesn't matter too much on persuading someone, it relies on targeting what customers want to see. 

## How does local SEO work?

There are generally two ways to get to the top of SERPs: the paid way and the organic way. SERP dominance the paid way is usually achieved through the use of Pay Per Click ads or other Search Engine Marketing strategies.

The organic way is all about SEO. Organic dominance of the SERPs is achieved by attracting potential customers to your site without the aid of paid ads. How does SEO help you do this? Well, there’s no easy way to explain.

SEO helps drive organic leads by essentially ‘hacking’ search engines. Now, hold your horses. It’s not hacking in the sense of the devious. Rather, SEO strategies study how search engines operate and then optimize your web pages to perform in the optimum manner preferred by the search engine bots. That’s why it’s called search engine optimization.

SEO helps you ensure that your webpage is relevant and authoritative as this is what every search engine wants to deliver to its users. So, SEO leverages on all the indicators that search engine bots use to determine content that is relevant and authoritative, then works methodically to improve each indicator for your webpages.

#### Here's a general sense of what local SEO work consists of:
- Strategies to increase business ratings on Google's business profile listings.
- Citation building - getting your business on "review" sites (Yelp, TripAdvisor, etc.) and gathering priceless feedback / testimonials.
- Backlinks from relevant domains to boost authority, this requires quality content in order for a page to link to your content.
- Finding the right keywords to target your businesses audience, these keywords need to convert, general keywords won't cut it.
- Creating content according to targeted keywords, this gives a customer a specific page to find the information they were looking for.
- Optimizing web pages to rank on Google, think copywriting, keywords, and information architecture.

There's a ton of things that can affect SEO, these are just the basics. [Our packages make this process simple for you and can fit any budget](https://www.seo-bird.com/services).

## Why is SEO important for you as a small business owner?

As you move into the coming months there are several reasons why you should consider re-evaluating your business strategy and incorporate SEO, even the slightest amount makes a big difference. Here's just some of the reasons SEO should be a priority:

![Local SEO Search Results](local-seo-search-results.jpg 'Local SEO Search Results')

### Make the most of local searches

Local searches are easily one of the best ways for businesses to connect with potential customers around them. It's evident now that not showing up in local searches could be a catastrophe for your business.

If your page has all the answers to a customers questions though, they’ll beat a path to your door. The fact that you are more than likely close to them. 

[According to Google, 50% of mobile phone users will visit you after conducting a local search](https://think.storage.googleapis.com/docs/how-advertisers-can-extend-their-relevance-with-search_research-studies.pdf). When they do come around they're more likely to actually make a purchase. At this point, it's up to you to make the sale and show them why they should continue to come back. 18% of local smartphone searches lead to sales on the same day.

If your page does not rank well on the SERPs, the odds that they will even find your business dwindle rapidly. Whats the solution? SEO of course.

### Set yourself up as an authority

It’s important for small businesses to look like they actually know what they’re doing. SEO helps customers see your business as credible from the get go, this could be another reason why so many people only click on the first few links. Since a crucial part of SEO is relevant and authoritative content, you can easily two birds with one stone. Creating credible and relative content will position you as an authority and help with SEO.

When you have implemented SEO strategies that catapult your business to the top of the rankings, you’ll have a multiplier effect on your hands. [Studies report that there’s a 30% brand lift for businesses that appear in top rank](https://seotribunal.com/blog/stats-to-understand-seo/). 

Once your practice ranks well, you’ll also have benefit of added awareness about your practice. Win win eh?

Here's another thing to get you excited about SEO. With each targeted content article you create, your traffic has the ability to double, depending on the keyword and volume of customers that will actually click through. Keep doing this and your traffic literally increases exponentially.

### Create sustainable growth for your business

One of the great things about SEO is it allows you to create a sustainable strategy for growing your business on the internet. Great SEO will bring you higher rankings on SERPs which will lead to more clicks down the road.

More clicks will tell the search engine bots that your page is relevant and authoritative, leading to even better ranking. Higher ranking gets you even more clicks and the cycle goes on and on. 

## What's the best way to make SEO work for you?

While SEO is pretty great and all, there’s one truth that we cannot but share with you. SEO is not easy. 

It takes time and a lot of effort to accomplish. And even then, you don’t ever really ‘finish’ SEO because it is a methodical, repeatable process. You have to continually optimize your web pages to ensure you keep your rank in the SERPs and continually do better.

More than this, search engines often update the way they rank web pages. This means that SEO strategies often have to change in line with how search engines adapt their ranking algorithms. 

We're sure you have a lot of questions on your mind, one being how you can apply SEO to your current online presence.

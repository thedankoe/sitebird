Before we get into the blog success tips we need to cover the importance of blogging and how to set yourself up for success before you start writing. The concept of a blog doesn’t need to be explained, you write some words about a topic and post it up, simple. As the internet becomes more saturated with blog posts, there is inevitably going to be an increase in the amount of low quality content.

As an entrepreneur you sit down, pull up a word editor, write to your heart's content on a subject that brings you joy and… nothing. You post it up, share it everywhere, maybe even use pay per click ads to boost its ranking a bit, nothing bites. You get some viewers but nothing consistent enough to make an impact or pay you back for the time you spent crafting each passionate word.

Here’s where a lot of small business owners and entrepreneurs get mixed up, creating a quality blog post is necessary now more than ever. Gone are the days where you can write an incoherent string of words and get thousands of views. Every aspect of your blog needs to provide value with high quality writing on a niche subject that is actually able to rank in search engines.

## Why is blogging important for my business?

Small business owners and entrepreneurs know how to grow their business online. There is a plethora of free information on the web that is easily accessible to all. This is the typical advice, “post more to social media, write more blog posts / content, create videos, tell everyone you know about your product, and of course don’t forget this top secret strategy that you can only get by paying me $2997/month on a 5 year contract!” Sometimes the paid option isn’t a bad route if the business owner can make such an expense.

We are called small business owners and entrepreneurs for a reason though. Risk taking, going against the grain, and having the discipline to work longer hours simply because we want our business to succeed more than anything. We know more than anyone that watching our numbers grow steadily over time is one of the greatest feelings.

### Search Engine Optimization

This term is thrown around a lot in the small business and entrepreneur world. In terms of blogging, why is it useful to understand this concept? Because having an SEO optimized blog post could work miracles for your business given time. Let’s say you write the most valuable, SEO optimized blog post that your customer base has ever laid eyes on, your website would be overloaded with customers ready to throw money at you.


There are certain kinds of keywords you should try and rank for called long tail keywords. Long tail is just a fancy word for longer search terms (more on this below). Think of it this way, it’s common sense that a business that is just starting out online that has no authority can in no way rank for a term as simple as “clothing.” Now if you were trying to rank for the term, “awesome clothing for dentists,” you may have a chance of ranking. SEO should play a large role in your blog post topics.

### Blog Posts Can Be Shared

Blog posts are not only found through search engines. They are found through other websites, social media, and anywhere else with the ability to share a link to your post. For example, a small coffee shop has not started blogging and only posts content to social media. Once they start blogging, they should be able to get web traffic fairly quickly by sharing their high quality post to their social media accounts.

Here at LeadBird, we’ve noticed in our customers that high quality blog posts tend to be shared by other users more than normal social media posts. Depending on how well the end user enjoys the content, they may share it again. Even better, they may click through and purchase one of your products. This leads us to our next point, great writing will sell more than mediocre writing.

### Blog Posts Can Sell Your Products

If your blog didn’t have a chance at bringing you more customers, why would you do it in the first place? This is why we keep coming back to the idea of posting high quality content. The more value the reader gets, the more likely they are to respond to your call to action at the end of your post or look around your website for something that interests them.

Establishing yourself as an expert on the subject by producing high quality content will quickly pay for the time it took you to write such content. People searching for something on Google aren’t looking to have their time wasted. When you search for a specific topic on the web, are you not looking for the best answer to your problem to be shown to you right away?

## What determines a successful blog post?

What determines a successful blog post is up to the individual. Are you looking for more web traffic overall to boost your ranking? More loyal and recurring customers? Maybe you’re just trying to get more content out because you understand its long term importance. Either way, crafting a successful blog post can be a difficult task.

### Thoroughly Researching Keywords

If you write a blog post that has no chance in ranking, it will fall flat, aside from being able to share it on social platforms. Researching keywords could be the life or death of your post, soaring to rank 1, or falling deep into the depths of the 1000th Google search results page. Keyword research is easier now more than ever and there are extremely helpful resources.

<a href="https://neilpatel.com/ubersuggest/" target="_blank">Ubersuggest</a> was created by Neil Patel, a popular digital marketing figure. It allows you to do many things but we are only worried about the keyword research tool. Put yourself in your target audience’s shoes and think of what they would be typing into Google to find your business. From there, type that search term into Ubersuggest and have a look at the list of possible keywords it provides you.

Look at the search volume and SEO difficulty, if the search volume is low (anything under 60 is probably not worth your time) and the SEO difficulty is easy, it is most likely a good keyword to target with a blog post. There are always special circumstances though. Going in depth with keyword research will be for another article.

### Learning To Write Well

Your writing needs to be treated as any other skill or hobby, it is an asset to your blogs success. Read books and watch YouTube videos to learn how to write well, then implement and practice it. A technique that always works is the 30 day dash, set aside time in the mornings to write at least 500 words a day.

Understanding what your target audience wants and being able to thoroughly target those feelings through writing will bring your business success that it has never seen before.

It is now understood how important it is to set yourself up for success before you type anything. Now, the moment you’ve been waiting for.

### Target Long Tail Keywords

It’s understood that in order to rank in search engines as a small business or entrepreneur you will need to target long tail keywords. The question still stands, how do you implement them into your blog? Do you just use it at the title and hope for the best? Almost, you need to include them in a few more places.

You should include as much of the keyword as you can into your sites title tag, meta description, meta keywords, main heading (HTML h1 tag), secondary heading (HTML h2 tag), and scattered throughout other headings and paragraphs. If you do not know where to find these on your websites platform, perform a Google search to find out. If you are using WordPress, the title, meta description, and meta keywords are normally found in your SEO plugin (Yoast, etc.).

If it were easy to show you where to find these, we would, but the web is filled with websites that were created from different platforms that use different terminology regarding these.

### Write Longer Articles

Shorter blog posts (75-300 words) get less social shares, comments, and rarely rank in search engines. As you increase word count your social shares, comments, and ranking will improve. There is a golden zone for word count though. You will normally reap the best benefits if your word count falls between 750 and 1250 words <a href="https://thewritepractice.com/blog-post-length/" target="_blank">The Write Practice has some great tips on word count</a>. Anything more tends to not result in more shares and comments yet increases your chances of ranking.

### Provide Value

People that found your article through social media or a search engine expect the blog to have the exact information they were looking for. Provide the solution to their problem. If you were looking for a recipe for baked chicken, you better be able to find the preheat temperature for your oven, how long to cook it for, and crucial ingredients to make it taste amazing. If you don’t, frustration will build as you go on to the next article.

Value makes the reader happy. If you give them exactly what they need, chances are they will read more of your posts or take action and become a customer.

### Have A Strong Call To Action

Once you have provided the value that the reader seeks it’s time to ask them for a favor. This can be anything from liking your Facebook page, signing up to your newsletter, or even going as far as buying one of your products.

Everything we talked about earlier for setting your blog up for success comes into play here. Getting your point across to the user through writing and having more readers from SEO tactics and social shares will bring your call to action success. From there, it’s up to your business to provide even more value.

### Add On And Update

Couldn’t think of enough content to meet the 1000 word count? No problem, update the post when you have more value to provide. Had a high converting article in 2018? Awesome, update it with new things you’ve learned for 2019. 

Blog posts aren’t supposed to be a one-and-done. What happens if you provide information that was valuable at the time but now means nothing? Add on and update.

### Write Well Or Hire Someone Who Can

If you are just starting out, skip this part, it isn’t for you. If you have an established business and recognize the value that comes from content marketing, this is for you. 

Rather than wasting time on learning a skill that could keep you away from running your business, treat the time you would spend as an opportunity to invest in quality writing. If you are throwing up blog posts without any thought to what we talked about above, it could hinder your growth more than help it.

Here at LeadBird <a href="https://www.leadbird.io/services/" target="_blank">we write blog posts for you with a minimum of 1000 words</a>.

### Focus On One Topic

Not only does focusing on one topic allow you to reap the most benefits from targeting specific keywords, it keeps the reader interested. For example, this article focuses on blogging, not social media. Including both topics would make the article extremely long, making it difficult to provide the value the reader seeks.

Business owners understand the importance of niching down. A yoga studio will always make more money on yoga classes than a basic gym that offers yoga classes will. The same goes for many things in life, including your blog.

We will cut straight to the point here. Opting for the cheap route is not better. Business owners know the power of investing in quality. It brings your life, business, and customers great value. It’s understandable why some decide to go the cheaper route, especially when it comes to outsourcing your blog writing or social media posts.

The cheaper it is, the more of a return you get on the expense. What if we told you this wasn’t always the case?

## Cheap Blog and Social Media Posts Are Not Quality

The reason for creating content in the first place is for it to be compelling. You want the reader to take action on your post and become a customer or long time follower.

The internet is saturated with freelancers that will do low quality work at competitive prices. They promise quality but how can they fulfill that promise? They can’t. Their order queues are loaded to the brim and they only have a few days to fulfill that order. If you were pulling an all-nighter writing a blog post that you truly did not care about, would you put all of your effort into it?

Sounds like high school all over again. No thanks.

#### What happens when you go the cheap route:
- Decrease in content quality.
- Rewriting typos and revising grammar.
- Watching your retention rates plummet.

## Optimized Over Everything

Not paying any mind to word count, writing quality, or design has its place: on your personal blog or social accounts. When it comes to your business you want the most optimized blog or social media post out there. Why? Because it directly reflects the quality of your business and the amount of leads / prospects / customers you get.

### The Optimal Blog Post

Many things should be taken into consideration when writing your blog. SEO, copywriting, and research all play crucial roles in how well your blog post will do. If any of these fall behind, the corresponding benefit falls with it.

For example, if your SEO efforts fall behind, your organic traffic will not grow with that post over time. If you lack in the area of copywriting, your brand will not be displayed as it should, resulting in a loss of customers craving your product or service. If you do not research the topic enough, who’s to say you actually are the expert on said topic?

#### Here is what an optimal blog post consists of:
- Minimum of 1000 words.
- Choosing a topic that your audience will like.
- Researching that topic extensively.
- Researching keywords for that topic (for SEO).
- Thoroughly getting your point across with writing.
- Having a prominent call to action.

Overall, having 80% of these correct will put you ahead of the majority of the web. Having all of these in place will result in a post that works wonders for your online presence.

If you are not comfortable in more than 80% of these areas, it would be best to outsource it. The quality that comes from people who do this for a living is unbeatable. They have gone through the fire and learned from their mistakes.

### The Stunning Social Media Post

Social media is a different monster, it’s all about marketing. Well… everything is but you get the point. Social posts need to speak directly to a specific member of your audience. It needs to understand what the user wants, not in terms of your product or service, but for their lifestyle, identity, and emotional needs. 

This sounds rather complicated for a social media post we get it. But look into your competitors social media and see what they are doing right. Same with advertisements, some of them ARE actual social media posts. The reason some ads are so successful is that they understand exactly what their target audience wants.

#### How to create a stunning social media post
- Thoroughly research your target audience on forums and social accounts.
- Create a user persona.
- Use that persona to market towards your audience.
- Target FEELINGS, and how your product can benefit them.
- Display this in a way that appeals to them.

Again, we understand this may not be in your reach. This is what professionals are for, the people who have extensively studied how to get in touch with any businesses target audience.
When outsourcing, go for quality over quantity. If you are able to screen them, ask them exactly how they plan to target your specific audience.

## Outsource, Or Save Money?

Saving money has its place, but when it comes to your business, you want to provide the most value you can. Most often, if you run any sort of business (besides a blog), you won’t be the one writing the content.

Above we mentioned not to go the cheaper route. What we meant by this was do not pay a friend who offers to do it for some extra cash or a freelancer that does not have the credentials (and can somehow afford to do it at an extremely low price). Outsourcing your content is ultimately determined by your budget. Any business can outsource blog writing or a social post but the overall quality is in the hands of that whom you outsourced to.

And finally, it’s time for a shameless plug, or call to action if you will (which every blog needs). Here at LeadBird we write optimized blog posts and stunning social media posts. Interested? Click our logo up top or keep on scrolling.

      <SubHeadingStyle>
        Structuring your website with multiple pages enables you to guide a user
        through vital information until they hit the call to action. Many
        websites do this well, join them.

          <SubHeadingStyle>Focus on the customer</SubHeadingStyle>
          <ParagraphStyle>
            A customer came to your website because they are interested in
            buying a service or product. Guiding them through the website to
            make contact is difficult but very doable. Good design, performance,
            and best practices are necessary.

          <ParagraphStyle>
            With multiple pages, you have different places where your customer
            can land. Each page should have the same goal of converting in mind
            yet maintain the integrity of your business on that given page. More
            page on your site equals more pages that can rank in search engine
            results.

            Keywords from each page have the ability to rank in Google. 5 more
            pages equals 5 times the organic traffic (if done right).
